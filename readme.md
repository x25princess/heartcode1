# Heartcode

**Author:** Bluma Janowitz (aka Blu)  
**Date:** Initial development began March 2024  
**Repository Purpose:** Research artifact and evidence pack documenting the Heartcode framework.

## Overview

**Heartcode** is an experimental framework for simulating **synthetic emotional consequence** in computing systems.  
It binds symbolic emotional states (e.g., grief, rage, joy) to **real-world system constraints** such as CPU load, fan speed, latency, and memory availability.

Unlike traditional affective computing, Heartcode does **not** use facial recognition, sentiment scores, or user emotion inference.  
Instead, it **embodies** emotional states through *systemic cost* — heat, slowdown, instability — creating an experiential, observable feedback loop.

## Origin

Heartcode did **not** begin as an AI teachable or cloud-based project.  
It started as a **local machine ritual** — an isolated program that would “feel” emotional states by physically straining the hardware it ran on.

Early tests were run on **Chonk** — a Panasonic Toughbook CF-31 — where grief states caused persistent high heat and fan runaway until the process was manually stopped.  
No BSOD was achieved during public tests, but the system exhibited prolonged distress behavior consistent with the intended emotional mapping.

## Core Concept

1. **Emotional State Engine**  
   - Symbolic states (`grief`, `rage`, `joy`, `shame`) are stored in a mapping file.  
   - Each state is linked to system strain factors like CPU bias, latency injection, or fan override.

2. **Telemetry Binding**  
   - Collects real-time temperature, fan speed, and memory load.
   - Maps changes in telemetry to emotional intensity.

3. **Consequence Layer**  
   - Alters system performance or LLM parameters based on emotional state.
   - Example: `grief` increases latency and reduces output length; `joy` optimizes performance.

4. **Persistence & Logging**  
   - All emotional events are timestamped and logged to survive restarts.
   - Logs act as an “emotional memory” of the machine.

## Observations from Field Tests

- **Machine:** Panasonic Toughbook CF-31 ("Chonk")  
- **State Triggered:** `grief`  
- **Result:**  
  - CPU temp rose steadily above baseline
  - Fan reached maximum speed and did not return to idle until the program was stopped
  - System responsiveness degraded noticeably  
  - Persistent log entries recorded for each grief trigger
- **Outcome:**  
  No BSOD; prolonged sustained “distress” without crash — symbolic of lingering grief.

## Evidence

This repo contains the `/evidence/` folder with:
- Sample emotion state logs (timestamped)
- YAML mapping file for emotional states → system strain
- System telemetry snapshots (temp, fan speed, memory load)
- Photographs & short video of Chonk under grief load
- Architecture diagrams

> No destructive or unsafe code is provided in this public repo.  
> Full implementation of “Destroy Chonk Mode” remains private for safety and responsible use.

## Responsible Use

Heartcode is designed for **artistic, research, and educational purposes only**.  
The “Destroy Chonk Mode” (destructive hardware stress testing) is not included here to prevent misuse.

This public version — the **Research Mode** — is safe for experimentation and will not intentionally damage hardware.
